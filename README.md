A simple tic tac toe game with AI (minimax) with basic heuristic and iterativ deepening


Execute the main file to play in the terminal
Execute the main_ig file to play with graphics mode (tkinter)

Algorithm :
  - Minimax with heuristic which compare the best possible alignments for the player and his opponent
  - Minimax with heuristic which compare the number of free case around the last played
  - Minimax with iterative deepening search (time limited) using the alignment heuristic
  - Basic MCTS which gives a score to each free cells in function of a number of randoms simulations
